# Full Stack E-Commerce Next.js Application

  <p>
Full-stack app developed at section 20 of a Next.js, Typescript & React course I've been following. The app includes three types of users: guest user, authenticated and admin. Features include a search bar, a favourites and a cart page, login and register, a reviews component, checkout and payment, and add a product feature for admin users.
As I've updated Next.js to version 15, I worked individually in order to debug parts of the application.
